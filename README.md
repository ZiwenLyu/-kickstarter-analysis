# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Lousie is raising fund through a wide variety of campaigns including theater plays, film and videos, and food with different launch time and various goals.This project is to uncover how fund raising outcomes of a specific category theater campaign vary based on their dates and goals. I will firstly find theater data from the kickstater dataset and group them by their launch datas and their funding goal amount perspectively, and visualize the data through line charts to see the trends. The project will include analysis, challenges, results, limitations, and suggestions for further analysis.

### Purpose
All theater campaign outcomes can be grouped into sucessful, failed, canceled, and live. And the outcomes may be related to their launch dates and funding goals.The purpose of the project is to explore how launch dates and funding goal amounts will effect outcomes of theater fund raising campaigns. Based on the analysis, data-driven results will be delivered to suggest better launch dates and more reasonal funding goals for theater campaigns.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
I created a pivot table and filtered data based on their parent category "theater" and their monthly launch dates. According to the chart and the table, there are 839 successful theater campaigns, 493 failed theater campaigns, 37 canceled theater campaigns. Apparantly, from April to August, there is a peak in successful campaigns. In May, there are 111 successful campaigns. While in December, there are only 37 successful campaigns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
I created an another table to see the counts of campaigns with differnt outcomes and their proportions. 


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
